# Scraping the web for meaningful data

Using [Beutifulsoup4](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) we will learn to get text data from the web, and present it in meaningful ways. It's pretty easy to get lumps of text from the web, the challenging and useful part is making sure it makes sense. The web is packed with curated and designed tables, paragraphs, and labels that make understanding stuff really easy. We can leverage those to see the meaningful things about about things!. 

## Objectives

- Learn to load Bs4 and turn a web page into a 'soup object'. 
- Understand the difference between a 'soup object' and a plain text import
- Navigate the web page using Bs4 directions.
- Search the web page for terms.
- Store the collected data.

### BONUS

- Crawl to other pages.
- Present your data in Pandas dataframe.
